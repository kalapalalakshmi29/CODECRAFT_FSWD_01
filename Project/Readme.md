# Flutter Authentication System

A comprehensive Flutter-based authentication mobile application with secure login, registration, and session management for efficient user access control.

## Project Requirements

Develop a mobile application that allows users to securely register, login, and access protected routes with proper authentication mechanisms.

Ensure the system has proper validation and security features to protect user credentials and maintain secure sessions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system with credential validation
- **Password Security**: SHA-256 password hashing for enhanced security
- **Session Management**: Persistent login sessions with secure token storage
- **Protected Routes**: Access control for authenticated users only
- **Form Validation**: Input validation for data integrity and user experience
- **Modern UI**: Dark-themed interface with gradient designs and animations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and tablet devices
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured codebase with separation of concerns

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

1. **Register**: Create a new account with email and password
2. **Login**: Access the system with valid credentials
3. **Dashboard**: View authenticated user dashboard
4. **Logout**: Securely end session and return to login

## Architecture

- **Models**: User authentication data structure with validation
- **Services**: Authentication and session management
- **Screens**: Login, Registration, and Dashboard UI components
- **State Management**: Efficient state handling for authentication flow
- **Local Storage**: Persistent session storage using shared preferences

## Dependencies

- `flutter/material.dart`: UI framework
- `shared_preferences`: Local data persistence
- `crypto`: Password hashing and security
- Built-in form validation and state management
